# Boogle (Google Clone) HTML/CSS Project.

## Description
This is my version of a Google Front-end clone without actually functioning.
Its purpose was to practice CSS and HTML skills in particular positioning and flexbox.
For the current version, it took me a few hours (4-8 not counted). 

My approach was to build it roughly similar without using Chrome Dev Tools.

## Technologies

- HTMl
- CSS

### Todo
+ Add media queries for the search bar. (Googles search bar adjusts below a certain screen-size, in this state it is optimized only for larger screens.) 
+ Change footer to split up into two lines similar to the original Google page.
