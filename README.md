# Boogle (Google Clone) HTML/CSS Project.

## Description
This is my version of a Google Front-end clone without actually functioning.
Its purpose was to practice CSS and HTML skills, in particular positioning and flex box.
For the current version, it took me a few hours (4-8 not counted). 

My approach was to build it roughly similar without using Chrome Dev Tools.

The name and graphics were changed to hopefully resolve any copyright issues, as this project is for presentation purposes only.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS

### To-do
+ Add media queries for the search bar. (Googles search bar adjusts below a certain screen size, in this state, it is optimized only for larger screens.) 
+ Change footer to split up into two lines, similar to the original Google page.
