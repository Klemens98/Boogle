# Boogle (Google Clone) HTML/CSS Project.

## Description
This is my version of a Google Front-end clone without actually functioning.
Its purpose was to practice CSS and HTML skills in particular positioning and flexbox.
For the current version, it took me a few hours (4-8 not counted). 

My approach was to build it roughly similar without using Chrome Dev Tools.

## Technologies

-HTMl
-CSS

### Todo
+ Add media query CSS for the search bar. (Googles search bar adjusts below a certain screen-size) 
+ Change footer two go into two lines like on the original Google page.
